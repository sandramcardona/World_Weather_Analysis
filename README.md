# World_Weather_Analysis

## Background
Jack loves the PlanMyTrip app created for them. Beta testers love it too. And, as with any new product, theyâ€™ve recommended a few changes to take the app to the next level. Specifically, they recommend adding the weather description to the weather data that has been already been retrieved. Then, the beta testers use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map will be created.

## Basic Project Plan

### Objective
Collect and analyze weather data across cities worldwide and create input statements to filter data based on weather preferences and using this information the data will be used to identify travel destinations and nearby hotels and a travel destination map with markers and an intinerary directions map and table will aslo be created. 

### Tasks

1 - Retrieve Weather Data
2 - Create a Customer Travel Destinations Map
3 - Create a Travel Itinerary Map

### Method

Create a Pandas DataFrame with 2000 world's unique cities and their weather data in real time. This process will entail collecting, analyzing, and visualizing the data.

### Results

Pandas DataFrame was successfully created and the Travel map directions and the map markers were able to be created using the dataframe.
